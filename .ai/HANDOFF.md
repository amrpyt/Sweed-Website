## Read First

- `.ai/PROJECT.md`
- `.ai/STATE.md`
- `.ai/TASKS.md`
- `.ai/decisions/DEC-013-uploaded-html-is-fidelity-source.md`
- `.ai/decisions/DEC-014-reference-fidelity-with-sweed-theme-bridge.md`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-reference-html-fidelity-restoration-design.md`

## Current Public Contract

- `/services`, `/portfolio`, and `/offers` use the exact approved executable HTML references as their structure/motion/interaction source.
- Their runtime typography and brand palette intentionally match the homepage: `SWEED Helvetica Arabic`, `#261b3e`, `#ed2062`, `#6d6e70`, and current light surfaces.
- Do not reintroduce reference Cairo/IBM Plex or the old `#241238` / `#D6246E` identity unless explicitly requested.
- Do not redesign or modernize the page compositions without explicit approval.
- Shared header, footer, AI advisor, routing, and Next runtime stay current.

## Latest Application Change

`cc1b55f fix: align reference pages with SWEED identity`

The reference normalizer now:
- keeps exact uploaded source bytes untouched;
- maps runtime reference colors to current SWEED brand roles;
- maps display/body typography to `SWEED Helvetica Arabic`;
- removes reference Google Fonts requests;
- themes inline SVG and script color literals;
- lets headings inherit section color so hero titles remain white.

## Verification

- Focused fidelity/theme tests: 11 passed.
- `bun run check`: 110/110 tests plus type/lint/design guards passed.
- Production build: 29 routes, passed.
- Production Playwright: 11 passed, 0 failed, 1 intentional mobile visual skip.
- Browser identity match verified against homepage.
- Desktop/390/320: no horizontal overflow.
- GSAP remains Services 76 / Portfolio 71 / Offers 42 ScrollTriggers.
- Google Fonts requests on the three reference pages: 0.
- Service active; public routes HTTP 200.

## Remaining Boundary

- Articles is not an executable-HTML fidelity route in the current reference batch.
- Do not push without explicit user approval.
